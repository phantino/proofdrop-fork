Perfect. You’re looking for a lean, high-demand crypto project that’s: •  In a trending niche •  Low-cost to launch •  Doesn’t require heavy coding Here’s a concept that checks all those boxes: ---  Project Idea: ProofDrop — Airdrop Reputation Protocol  Concept Overview ProofDrop is a decentralized protocol that tracks and verifies users’ participation in crypto airdrops. It creates a reputation score based on wallet activity, helping projects identify real users vs. bots or farmers. ---  Why It’s in Demand • Airdrops are booming: Projects use them to attract users, but many get gamed by bots. • Reputation is key: Users want to prove they’re legit to qualify for future drops. • Projects want targeting: They need tools to filter out low-quality wallets. ---  Minimal Build Requirements You can launch a basic MVP with: • A simple frontend (React or even Webflow) • Wallet connect (via WalletConnect or MetaMask) • Backend logic using The Graph or Moralis to fetch wallet history • Smart contract (optional) to mint a “ProofDrop Badge” NFT No need to build a full blockchain or complex protocol—just plug into existing infra. ---  Monetization & Token Utility • Token Utility:• Stake to boost reputation • Pay for premium analytics • Governance over scoring algorithm • Revenue Streams:• Projects pay to access user scoring API • Users pay small fees to verify wallets or mint badges ---  Growth Strategy • Partner with launchpads and airdrop platforms • Offer free scoring for early users • Gamify reputation: Leaderboards, NFT badges, social sharing ---  Tokenomics Sketch Allocation Percentage Team 15% Investors 20% Community Rewards 30% Treasury 20% Liquidity 15% ---  Cost to Build • Frontend: <$1,000 if using templates • Backend/API: Free with Moralis or The Graph • Smart Contract Audit: Optional for MVP • Marketing: Focus on Twitter, Discord, and collabs --- How can i do this myself with a $10 budgetAlso the scoring logic is Total Possible Points: 100Wallet Age (10 points)
Measures: Months since first transactionGas Spent (10 points)
Measures: Total ETH/BNB/etc. gas paidUnique Contract Interactions (20 points)
Measures: Number of distinct smart contracts interacted withGovernance Participation (20 points)
Measures: Votes cast / proposals createdDeFi Engagement (20 points)
Measures: Lending, staking, farming, liquidity provisionAirdrops Claimed (20 points)
Measures: Number of distinct airdrops received
also can you write a code which i can deploy on github pages or vercel with a very nice landing page considering that i am new to coding so a real step by step break down on how to go will be appreciated.  and the other components attached using different test networks and mainnets and also without having to install anything on my machine and can you write a code which i can deploy on github pages or vercel with a very nice landing page and the other components attached using different test networks and mainnets and also without having to install anything on my machine and can you write a code which i can deploy on github pages or vercel with a very nice landing page and the other components attached using different test networks and mainnets and also without having to install anything on my machine and can we also use covalent and moralis to fetch data for the scoring logic?
also after calculating and scoring its meant to give you badge based on your score. for example if you score 80+ you are a diamond or you are a human, and then it can have different ones you can figure it out. also an option where it supports multiple networks(both mainnets and testnets) and it uses wagmi or a web3 modal to pick which wallet to use. also there should be a button after connecting your wallet where you will click to get your score like a "mint your Score/humanity" button.
